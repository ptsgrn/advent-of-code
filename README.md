# advent-of-code by ptsgrn

This is my repo for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. I'm using [Bun](https://bun.sh) to run the code.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run, you need to create a file called `input.txt` in the folder for the day you want to run. Then run:

```bash
bun run 2023/day01/day01.ts
```

And in watch mode:

```bash
bun run --watch 2023/day01/day01.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.15. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
